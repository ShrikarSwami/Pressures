        <h1>Why these pressures hurt</h1>
        <p className="lede">
          These notes are not medical advice. They explain why someone might feel pulled toward self-harm,
          restriction, or withdrawal, and why none of this makes you weak. If any of this feels close to
          home, talking with a professional is a healthy step.

        <h2>Why someone might think about self-harm</h2>
        <p>
          Self-harm thoughts often show up when emotional pain feels too big to hold and words feel
          impossible. The nervous system goes into alarm mode, and hurting the body can seem like the only
          way to release pressure or feel something different.
        </p>
        <p>
          This urge is a signal for support, not a personal failure. Safer alternatives—like grounding,
          breath work, or talking with someone—can lower the intensity. Professional help adds structure
          and safety plans tailored to you.
        </p>

        <h2>Why restriction and starvation can feel “in control”</h2>
        <p>
          When life feels chaotic, controlling food or shrinking your body can feel like the only thing
          that is manageable. Hunger can be misread as discipline or worth. This is a common, dangerous
          coping pattern—not a badge of strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bodies need steady nourishment to regulate mood and stress. If you notice restrictive thoughts,
          loop in a doctor, dietitian, or therapist early. Support is about protecting your health, not
          judging you.
        </p>

      <section className="learn-section">
        <h2>Heartbreak, abandonment, and panic</h2>
        <p>
          Losing someone you trusted can feel like withdrawal. Your brain may treat silence as danger,
          causing tightness in your chest, racing thoughts, or dissociation. These are protective reactions
          to hurt, not proof that you are broken.
        </p>
        <p>
          Panic often lessens when you have safe people to sit with you, plus simple tools like paced
          breathing. Ongoing panic is worth discussing with a clinician who can tailor care.

      <section className="learn-section">
        <h2>Helper burnout and worth tied to output</h2>
        <p>
          Being the “strong friend” or tying your value to productivity can push you past healthy limits.
          When rest feels unsafe, your body may force a shutdown: numbness, irritability, or fog.
        </p>
        <p>
          Boundaries, rest, and asking for help are skills, not weaknesses. Peer support and professional
          guidance can rebuild capacity so you are not burning out in silence.
