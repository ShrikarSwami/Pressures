        <h1>Why these pressures hurt</h1>
        <p className="lede">
          These notes are not medical advice. They simply explain why heartbreak, burnout, body image
          struggles, and panic can feel so intense, and why none of it means you are weak.

        <h2>Heartbreak can feel like withdrawal</h2>
        <p>
          When a relationship ends, your brain loses a source of safety and routine. The sudden silence can
          trigger alarm signals, which is why your chest might feel tight or you keep checking your phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rumination and anger often show up as attempts to regain control. These reactions are common and
          can soften when you have people around you who let you grieve without rushing you.

        <h2>Why helpers burn out</h2>
        <p>
          Being the steady friend can train you to ignore your own needs. If you are always the fixer,
          your nervous system rarely gets to rest, and you might feel numb or irritable once the crisis
          call ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Boundaries are not rejection. Sharing the load and naming when you need space are skills that keep
          you available without emptying yourself.

        <h2>Body image and control</h2>
        <p>
          When life feels chaotic, controlling food or exercise can seem like the only stable thing. That
          control can slide into harsh rules or restriction, which can harm both mood and health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Speaking to someone about body shame is difficult, especially for men who are taught to “tough it
          out.” You deserve support and nourishment without having to earn it.
        </p>

      <section className="learn-section">
        <h2>Panic, blackouts, and dissociation</h2>
        <p>
          Under overwhelming stress, the nervous system can slam on the brakes. That might feel like a
          blackout, a fog, or a sudden rush of adrenaline that makes ordinary tasks impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are protective responses, not failures of character. Grounding, breath work, and
          professional support can retrain the alarm system so it does not stay stuck on high alert.
