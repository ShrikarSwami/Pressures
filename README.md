# Pressures

Pressures is a mobile-first Vite + React web app that surfaces the emotional pressures men often carry in silence. Anonymous snippets are paired with gentle explanations, a reflection tracker, curated resources, and a memorial page that reminds readers how urgent support can be.

## Getting started

1) Install dependencies: `npm install --cache .npm-cache`  
2) Dev server: `npm run dev`  
3) Production build: `npm run build`

## Pages

- Home: overview, safety banner, and entry into the experience.
- Pressures: scrollable cards with tags, “This resonates with me” tracking (localStorage), related resources, and anonymized peer support notes.
- Learn: plain-language sections explaining why self-harm urges, restriction, heartbreak, panic, and burnout show up.
- Help: crisis and professional support guidance, including 988 (US) and global search suggestions.
- Memorial: estimated-attempt timer (since page open) plus a semicolon reveal reminding visitors to keep going and seek help.

## Safety

- This is for awareness and reflection only; it is not therapy or medical advice.
- Avoids graphic descriptions or instructions. Crisis nudges and resource links are provided throughout.
- If anything feels overwhelming, pause and reach out to a trusted person or a crisis line in your region.
