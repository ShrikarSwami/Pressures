# Pressures

Pressures is a mobile-first Vite + React web app that surfaces the emotional pressures men often carry in silence. Anonymous fragments are paired with simple explanations, reflection tools, and curated crisis resources. The interface is designed to be quiet, respectful, and direct—while the memorial page highlights how urgent unseen suffering can be.

Pages
Home — Overview, safety banner, and entry point.

Pressures — Scrollable emotional fragments with tags, “This resonates with me” tracking (saved in localStorage), and gentle peer-context elements.

Learn — Plain-language explanations of why urges, panic, disordered eating, heartbreak, numbness, and burnout appear under extreme stress.

Help — Guidance toward professional and crisis support, including 988 (US) and suggestions to search for local lines globally.

Memorial — Estimated-attempt counter (since page open) and a semicolon reveal reminding visitors to pause and seek help.

Safety
This project is for awareness and reflection only. It is not therapy, treatment, or medical advice.

Avoids graphic instructions; crisis-support cues appear throughout the interface.

If any part feels overwhelming, please pause the experience and reach out to someone you trust or a crisis hotline in your region.

<sub><sub>Quiet note for developers: the memorial message source files contain heavy raw text. Avoid browsing them casually unless you feel steady and know what you are doing.</sub></sub>
